# Notes

## Programming basics: Linear Models

Syntactic element: **formulas**. Formulas provide a way of using variables "symbolically." This is useful, for instance, in depicting the desired relationship among variables. Two forms:

- `y ~ x` two-sided
- `~ x` one-sided
- NOT ALLOWED, `y ~`

Important functions: 

- `lm()`, `predict()` , `anova()`, `summary()`.
- For later: `solve()`, `model.matrix()`.
- From 155: `coef()`, `fitted()`, `resid()`

Training with `lm()`: Specify formula `Y ~ X1 + X2` ...

```{r}
data(College, package = "ISLR")
mod <- lm(Outstate ~ Enroll + Accept + perc.alumni, data = College ) 
coef(mod)
```

What kind of thing is `mod`?

Model output with `predict()`
```{r}
predict(mod, 
        newdata = data.frame(Enroll = 100, Accept = 1000, perc.alumni = 25))
```

What kind of thing is the output of `predict()`?

```{r}
predict(mod, interval = "confidence",
        newdata = data.frame(Enroll = 100, Accept = 1000, perc.alumni = 25))
predict(mod, interval = "prediction",
        newdata = data.frame(Enroll = 100, Accept = 1000, perc.alumni = 25))
```

Why is the "confidence interval" so much narrower than the "prediction interval?"

**Inference** with `anova()` and `summary()`. This is all "in-sample" inference, not cross-validated.

```{r}
M <- model.matrix(~ Enroll + Accept * perc.alumni, data = College)
qr.solve(M, College$Outstate)
```

For the people who have had linear algebra, why doesn't this work?
```{r error = TRUE}
solve(M, College$Outstate)
```

## Review of Day 4, Sept 15, 2016

* Discussed the linear regression architecture and how it relates to machine learning.
    - linear regression is designed to work even in "small data" situations where
        a. cross-validation is not appropriate
        b. the number of model degrees of freedom may be almost as large as $n$
    - provides a ready definition of the "size" of a model: the number of coefficients.
* Introduced the main software used in linear regression, `lm()` and `predict()`
* Programming basics: indexing of vectors, matrices and data frames.

## Regression and Interpretability

Regression models are generally constructed for the sake of interpretability:

* Global linearity
* Coefficients are indication of effect size. The coefficients have physical units.
* Term by term indication of statistical significance

An example on `College` data from `ISLR` package 

```{r}
data(College, package="ISLR")
College$Yield <- with(College, Enroll/Accept)
mod1 <- lm(Yield ~ Outstate + Grad.Rate + Top25perc, data = College)
mosaic::rsquared(mod1)
mod2 <- lm(Yield ~ . - Grad.Rate, data = College)
mosaic::rsquared(mod2)
```
* What variables matter?
* How good are the predictions?
* How strong are the effects?

## Toward an automated regression process

In machine learning, we ask the computer to identify patterns in the data. 

* In "traditional" regression (which is still very important), we specify the explanatory terms and the computer finds the "best" model with those terms: least squares. 
* In machine learning, we want the computer to figure out which terms, of all the possibilities, will lead to the "best" model.


## Selecting model terms

The regression techniques 

- Traditional regression: 
    - Our knowledge of the system being studied.
    - Heirarchical principal
        * main effects, then
        * interaction.
- Machine learning
    - Look at all combinations of variables? 
    - Activity 1: 
        * Write a statement that will pull 2 random variables from a data frame *and* the explanatory variable.
        * Use `Yield ~ .` as the formula.
```{r}
explanatory_vars <- names(College)[-19]

my_vars <- sample(explanatory_vars, size = 12)
new_data <- College[ , c(my_vars, "Yield")]
mod <- lm(Yield ~ ., data = new_data)
mosaic::rsquared(mod)
mod
2^18
```
        
- Activity 2: 
        * How many combinations are there of $k$ explanatory variables? Calculate this for $k = 5, 10, 15, 20$. How many are there in the `College`?
        * What about with interactions?
- How long does it take to fit a model?
```{r}
system.time( do(1000) * lm(Yield ~ ., data=College))
256*7/3600
```

```{r}
names(College)
```
    
With $k$ explanatory variables, $2^k$ possibilities, not even including interactions. Including first-order interactions, it's
    $2^k + 2^{k(k-1)/2}$. Calculate this for $k=3.
    - Increase in $R^2$? Problem: $R^2$ will always go up as we add a new term.
    - Some other measure that takes into account how much $R^2$ should go up.



## Programming basics: Graphics

```{r}
plot(1, type = "n", xlim = c(100,200), ylim = c(300,500))
```

Basic functions:

1. Create a frame: `plot()`.  Blank frame: `plot( , type="n")`
    - set axis limits, 
2. Dots: `points(x, y)`, `pch=20`
3. Lines: `lines(x, y)` --- with `NA` for line breaks
4. Polygons: `polygon(x, y)` --- like lines but connects first to last.
    - fill
5. Color, size, ... `rgb(r, g, b, alpha)`, "tomato"

## Day 5 Summary

### Linear regression

* Discussed "interpretability" of linear models, e.g. meaning of coefficients, confidence intervals, R^2, etc.
    - which variables are "important" via ANOVA and mean sum of squares
* Discussed metrics to compare models 
    - R^2 -- not fair, since "bigger" models are always better
    - Punishment: Two criteria for judging
        - R^2
        - How big the model is.
        - These two are somehow combined together into "adjusted R^2." We'll say more about that today.
    - Cross-validation. Judge each model on its "out of sample" prediction performance.

### Coefficients as quantities

Coefficients in linear models are not just numbers, they are physical quantities with dimensions and units.

* Dimensions are always (dim of response)/(dim of this term)
* The model doesn't depend on the units of these quantities.  The units only set the magnitude to the numerical part of the coefficient, but as a quantity a coefficient is the same thing regardless of units.
* Conversion from one unit to another by multiplying by 1, but expressed in different units, e.g. 60 seconds per minute, 2.2 pounds per kilogram.


### Graphics basics

1. API for graphics: `plot()`, `points()`, `lines()`, `polygon()`, `text()`, ...


## K-nearest neighbors

K-nearest neighbors is a simple, general kind of function-building method.  But some problems:

* Interpretability: but you can always take partial derivatives.
* When you have prediction (aka "explanatory") variables in dollars and in miles, how do you calculate the distance between points?  What are the dimensions of distance?
    - Dimensionality refers to the physical feature, e.g. time, distance, area, volume, money, charge, luminance, mass, ...
    - Units are the ways in which dimensions are measured, e.g., cups, gallons, liters ... all refer to volume
        * Give some examples of units for each of the dimensions.
        * Some everyday quantities are dimensionless, e.g. pure numbers.  Give some examples: ... (angles, percent, fractions, ... but not ratios in general.)
    - Regression fixes units automatically, since the coefficients themselves have dimensionality. They will adjust automatically to changes in units, so the model is the same regardless of whether we use miles, km, parsecs, ... 
    - In KNN, to avoid dependence on units, need to do some standardization by dividing by something in the same units, e.g. sd.
* Curse of dimensionality.
    Let's create 1000 randomly placed points in the unit square:
```{r}
rpts <- matrix(runif(2*1000), ncol=2)
```

What's the distribution of distances from a single random point to the 1000 others:
```{r}
our_point <- runif(2)
```

The distance between our point and each of the others
```{r}
tmp <- matrix(our_point, ncol=2, nrow=1000, byrow=TRUE)
delta <- sqrt(rowSums((rpts - tmp)^2))
```

* How far away is a typical point?
* Write a function that takes the matrix of points and the "our point" and finds the distance from our point to each and every one of the points in the matrix.
* How far away is a typical point in 1-dimensional space?
* In 10-dimensional space?
* In 100-dimensional space?

Drawing a histogram.

## Day 6 Summary

* $R^2$ 
    - var(fitted) / var(response)
    - partitioning of variance: 
        - var(fitted) + var(resid) = var(response)
        - same with sum of squares: SS(fitted) + SS(resid) = SS(response)
* Adjusted $R^2$
    - $R^2$ vs $p$ picture
    - Derive a formula from the picture: we've got $p+1$ df to get from $R^2 = 0$ to our observed $R^2$, so $n - (p+1)$ df left for the residuals. Rate of increase due to junk is $(1 - R^2) / (n - p - 1)$. Projecting back $p$ terms gives an adjustment of $(1 - R^2) / \frac{p}{n - p - 1}$. Subtract this from $R^2$.
    - Wikipedia gives two formulas:
        - $Adj R^2 = {1-(1-R^{2}){n-1 \over n-p-1}}$ -- this projects back $n-1$ terms from 1.
        - $Adj R^2 = {R^{2}-(1-R^{2}){p \over n-p-1}}$ --- projects back $p$ terms from $R^2$.
        
- Adjusted $R^2$
- Whole model ANOVA.
- ANOVA on model parts


## Measuring Accuracy of the Model

* $R^2$ = Var(fitted)/Var(response)
* Adjusted $R^2$ - takes into account estimate of average increase in $R^2$ per junk degree of freedom
* Residual Standard Error - Sqrt of average square error per residual degree of freedom. The sqrt of the mean square for residuals in ANOVA.

## Bias of the model

You need to know the "truth" to calculate the bias. We don't.

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Chapter-2/2.1.png")
```

* Perhaps effect of TV goes as sqrt(money) as media get saturated?
* Perhaps there is a synergy that wasn't included in the model?

### Theory of whole-model ANOVA.

Standard measure: 
$\frac{\mbox{Explained amount}}{\mbox{Unexplained amount}}$

Examples:

- Standard error of mean:  $\frac{\hat{\mu}}{\sigma / n}$ -- note the $n$.
- t statistic on difference between two means: $\frac{\hat{\mu}_1 - \hat{\mu}_2}{\sigma / (n-1)}$
- F statistic: $\frac{SS / df1}{SSR / df2}$
    - df1 is the number of degrees of freedom involved by the model or model term under consideration.
    - df2 is $n - (p - 1)$ where $p$ is the total degrees of freedom in the model.  (I called this $m$ in the Math 155 book.)  The intercept is what the $-1$ is about: the intercept *can never* account for case-to-case variation.

Trade-off between eating variance and consuming degrees of freedom.




## Forward, backward and mixed selection

Use the `College` model to demonstrate each of the approaches by hand.  Start with `pairs()` or write an `lapply()` for the correlation with `Yield`?

Create a whole bunch of model terms

- "main" effects
- "interaction" effects
- nonlinear transformations: powers, logs, sqrt, steps, ...
- categorical variables

Result: a set of $k$ vectors that we're interested to use in our model.

Considerations:

- not all of the $k$ vectors may pull their weight
- two or more vectors may overlap in how they eat up variance

Algorithmic approaches:

- Try all combinations, pick the best one.
    - computationally expensive/impossible $2^k$ possibilities
    - what's the sensitivity of the process to the choice of training data?
- "Greedy" approaches


     
## Programming Basics: Functions

1. Syntax of functions:
```r
name <- function(arg1, arg2, ...) {
  body of function. Can use arg1, arg2, etc. 
}
```

* typically you will return a value. The value calculated by the last command line in the body is what's returned. Or you can use `return()` at any point in the function.
* Often functions are designed to produce "side effects", e.g. graphics.  
* Scope: what happens in functions stays in functions.

1. Create a plotting frame: `plot()`
    - Write a function that makes this more convenient to use. What features would you like. 
    ```{r}
    blank_frame <- function(xlim, ylim) {
      
    }
    ```
2. Write a function to draw a circle.
    - What do you want the interface to look like? What arguments are essential? What options are nice to have?

  geom_rug(aes(color = group)) + 
 # facet_grid( . ~ group) +
  xlim(-0.5, 1.5)
```

## Review of Day 7

- We finished reviewing adjusted R^2 and ANOVA.
- Started talking about linear algebra.

We only got through the first few elements in our review of linear algebra.  Let's go through them again




## Using predict() to calculate precision

- confidence intervals
- prediction intervals

## Conclusion

This wraps up our look at linear regression. Main points:

* model output is a linear combination of the inputs.
* `lm()` finds the "best" linear combination.
* rich theory relating to precision of coefficients and the residuals.
* traditional ways of applying that theory: F tests and t tests.
