# In-class course evaluation for Math 253

December 1, 2016, Prof. Kaplan

The College requires all faculty to provide an opportunity for students to comment, anonymously, on the quality of each course. This serves two distinct purposes:

1. To enable the administration (typically department chairs) to monitor the students' perceptions of the quality of instruction.
2. To guide the course instructor in improving course syllabi, materials, and instruction.

In the jargon of the education business, these are called "evaluative" and "formative" feedback respectively. In reality, there is no firm distinction since the merits and demerits of the items in (2) and other factors such as class size, which are sometimes out of the instructor's control, inevitably color the results of (1).

## Quality of instruction

a. Please give a number that summarizes your overall view of the instruction in this course on a scale from 1 to 5. Consider that 1 means "in the bottom fifth of all courses I've taken at Macalester" and 5 means "in the top fifth."
b. If you care to, please describe briefly any specific factors that strongly influenced your rating in (a).

## Course outcomes

Here, I want you to think about the extent to which the course contributed to your education. 

- If you were magically transported back to the time of course registration, knowing what you would get out of the course in the end, would you register for the course again? Scale: 1 "absolutely not" to 5 "eagerly"
- Would you recommend to a friend to take this course? Same scale as above.
- Did this course increase or decrease your interest in the following areas? Scale: 1 "decreased" to 5 "increased."
    - Statistics / data-science:
    - Computing generally:
- Is your primary area of interest outside of statistics/computing? Please circle yes or no. If you circle yes, please give the extent to which what you learned in this course is relevant to your primary interest? Scale: 1 "not at all" to 5 "strongly related."

## Course organization

a. Please comment on the balance between computing practice and statistical/mathematical theory in the course.  Scale: 1 means "too computational", 5 means "too theoretical", 3 means "about right."
b. Were the daily computational projects worth the time? Scale: 1 means "waste of time", 5 means "well worth the time."
c. Please rate these separate aspects of the ISLR textbook. Scale: 1 means "horrible", 5 means "highly instructive."
    - The chapter exposition.
    - The exercises.
    - The computer "lab" sections in each chapter.
d. **Honestly** describe the extent to which you used the book. I ask this question not to evaluate you, but to evaluate whether the text is satisfactory. Scale: indicate your agreement or disagreement with the statement. 1 means "strongly disagree" while 5 means "strongly agree."
    1. "I read the chapters diligently":
    2. "I enjoyed the readings I did."
    3. "The book content was at a level that is accessible to me."
e. I would like to know the extent to which you would have benefitted from more individual or small-group attention from the instructor. Here I want you to be careful to distinguish between two things: 
    1. the extent to which the instructor, due to his own qualities or flaws, *could potentially have* be helpful in providing such attention had there been sufficient time. Scale: 1 "not at all" to 5 "very much." This is intended to be an evaluation of the instructor.
    2. the extent to which, due to lack of time and availability, the size of the class, etc. you could not receive as much individual attention as you would like. Scale: more opportunity for individual/small-group help would have been 1 "unimportant" to 5 "very helpful." This is intended to be an evaluation of whether the College has provided sufficient resources for the effective instruction of this class.
    
## The future

As you may know, next semester will be my last at Macalester. Of my own choice, after 20+ years at Macalester and 30+ years in academia, I'm moving on to other opportunities.

- Starting next year, Profs. Addona and Johnson will have primary responsibility for the course. Do you have any suggestions for changes they should make to the course?
